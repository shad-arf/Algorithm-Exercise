# Algorithm Exercise

## Overview

This repository is a collection of algorithm exercises, with a primary focus on solving the Tower of Hanoi problem. The goal of this project is to help users practice and improve their algorithmic thinking by exploring different variations of the Tower of Hanoi and experimenting with the provided HTML-based solutions.

## Exercises

* **Tower of Hanoi Solutions**

  * **E1\_A.html**: First variation of the Tower of Hanoi exercise with a step‐by‐step demonstration.
  * **E1\_B.html**: Second variation showcasing a different approach or visualization.
  * **E1\_C.html**: Third variation illustrating another method or optimization.
* **Index (index.html)**

  * Acts as the entry point for all algorithm exercises. From here, you can open each individual Tower of Hanoi variation in your browser.

## Technology Stack

* **HTML**
  All exercises are implemented as standalone HTML files. No additional backend or framework is required—just open each file in a modern web browser to run the demonstrations.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shad-arf/Algorithm-Exercise.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd Algorithm-Exercise
   ```

3. **Open the index page**

   * In your file explorer or terminal, locate `index.html` and open it with your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
   * From the index page, click on any of the Tower of Hanoi variations (E1\_A.html, E1\_B.html, E1\_C.html) to view that exercise.

4. **Explore the variations**

   * Each HTML file contains its own implementation and visualization of the Tower of Hanoi solution. Feel free to view the source code to see how the problem is solved and rendered.

## Usage

* Simply open the HTML files in a browser—no server is required.
* Use the “Back” or “Home” link (if available) in each exercise to return to the index and try other variations.
* Study the JavaScript (if embedded) or the HTML structure to understand the recursive or iterative approach used for each solution.
